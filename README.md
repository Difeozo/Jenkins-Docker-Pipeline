Title:
Jenkins, Maven, and Docker CI/CD Pipeline with AWS Integration

Description:
This project showcases a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline built using Jenkins, Maven, Docker, and AWS CodePipeline. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes for a Java-based application, ensuring consistent and reliable software delivery.

Key Features:

Jenkins: Configured as the CI server to automate the build process, triggering builds upon code commits and integrating with GitHub for version control.
Maven: Utilized for project management and build automation, managing dependencies, and packaging the application.
Docker: Containerized the application to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.
AWS CodePipeline: Integrated to automate the deployment process, enabling seamless updates to the application in the AWS environment.
This project serves as a practical example of modern DevOps practices, illustrating the synergy between popular tools and cloud services for efficient software delivery.
